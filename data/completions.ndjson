The Cuban Missile Crisis unfolded over a period of 13 days in October 1962, with the resolution coming in the form of a diplomatic agreement.

While both of these conflicts were Cold War related, they were also very different in terms of causes, objectives, strategic objectives and outcomes. The Cuban Missile Crisis did not result in any direct military conflict and was resolved primarily through diplomacy and the decision to withdraw nuclear weapons from Cuba.
